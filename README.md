# Diabetes-Prediction
🧠 Diabetes Prediction using PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
This project is focused on predicting the onset of diabetes in women using machine learning algorithms applied to the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. The aim is to compare the performance of various models and evaluate their accuracy to assist in early diagnosis.

📌 Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction can help in taking precautionary steps and reducing health risks. This project uses patient health parameters to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
